# Platformango Game Project

This project was developed as the final exam project for CENG454. Below you will find an overview of the game, key features, level designs, and challenges faced during development.

## Game Overview

In this platformer game, you control the main character who can move left, right, and jump. The game includes various checkpoints and enemies. Upon touching an enemy or hazard, the character dies and respawns at the last checkpoint passed. The player can restart from the last checkpoint by pressing any key.

## Key Features

### Movement and Mechanics
- **Character Movement:** The main character can move left, right, and jump.
- **Checkpoints:** Located at various points in the game. The character respawns at the last checkpoint upon death.
- **Enemies and Hazards:** Various enemies and hazards (birds, fish, spikes, water, lava) cause the character to die on contact.
- **Respawn Mechanism:** Press any key to restart from the last checkpoint.

### Power-Ups
- **Double Jump:** Allows the character to jump twice.
- **Speed Up:** Doubles the character's speed for 5 seconds.
- **Low Gravity:** Reduces gravity's effect for 10 seconds, essential for navigating certain paths.
- **Coins:** Collecting coins strengthens the character, enhancing their abilities.

### Environment Interactions
- **Icy Platforms:** The character cannot jump on icy platforms and must gain momentum to climb. Jumping off the ice and bouncing on a trampoline helps progress to the next challenge.
- **Boat Journey:** Taking the lower path involves a perilous boat journey through aggressive fish.

## Level Design and Challenges

### Level 1
- **Checkpoint System:** Multiple checkpoints to ensure progress retention.
- **Hazards:** Includes enemies and environmental hazards like spikes and lava.
- **Power-Ups:** Includes double jump, speed up, and low gravity.
- **Level End:** Reaching the door at the end leads to the next level.

### Level 2
- **Reduced Jumping Ability:** Character's jumping ability is reduced at the start.
- **Double Jump Power-Up:** Provided again in case it was missed in Level 1.
- **New Checkpoint:** Climbing the "LEVEL 2" text sets a new checkpoint.
- **2x Speed Power-Up:** Available for challenge seekers; can make tasks easier or harder.
- **Flame Clouds and Swinging Axes:** Use the bouncing power of red flame clouds to navigate past swinging axes.
- **Suspension Bridges:** Collect coins while crossing suspension bridges.
- **Finish Line:** Touching the door with the "Finish" sign ends the game. Pressing any key restarts from the beginning.

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges
- **Animation Implementation:** Difficulties adding extra animations for actions like dying, taking damage, and climbing.
- **Main Menu and Sound Effects:** Encountered issues while adding the main menu and sound effects.

### Solutions and Workarounds
- **Debugging Animations:** Spent additional time debugging to ensure animations played correctly.
- **Menu and Sound Integration:** Researched and implemented solutions for integrating the main menu and sound effects without causing errors.

## Conclusion

This platformer game developed for the CENG454 final exam project showcases various features such as character movement, checkpoints, power-ups, and environmental interactions. Despite facing challenges with animations and integration of menu and sound effects, the game provides a comprehensive and engaging experience with multiple levels and increasing difficulty.
